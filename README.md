GetSusie
========

Shell script - Retrieve automatically Epitech English teacher's meetings (Obsolete) - FINISHED
The teachers are called "Susies".

I'm keeping it as a base to next scripts i would do.
Basicly parsing Web-page after logging in to retrieve info and compare if new info came.
Then show results using xmessage for instance.

Obsolete because the website has got an update and i don't need to go to those meetings anymore =P.
